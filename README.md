# CopyQat
A Client / Server file transfer program. 
Currently command line only. Unfortunately 
I lost the original code for the GUI based 
version so I'm starting over from scratch. 

* As of now client / server file transfers across networks are working
* The GUI is in a fragile state but can send at least one file
* Checking out the repo won't be very interesting for a while

### For usage information type:
* *your_prompt$>* __python clientdriver.py --help__ 
* *your_prompt$>* __python serverdriver.py --help__
